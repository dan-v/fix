# Differential-eval universe for fix vs a reference Nix: flattens nixpkgs'

# evaluates per-PR) into a single attrset of
#
#   { "<attr.path>" = "<drvPath>" | null; }
#
# where null means the attr threw during evaluation (caught with tryEval).
# The drvPath hashes the complete derivation closure, so equality of this
# attrset between two evaluators certifies agreement on everything that fed
# into each package. Both engines evaluate this same file, so the recursion
# and error-catching policy are identical on both sides by construction.
